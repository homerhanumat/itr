## convertGC
##
## This is a specific routine for reading class lists which comes from the Portal
## at Georgetown College and producing a classlist file usable by WeBWorK

## It is modified from a script written for the University of Rochester.

## IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE INPUT FILE IS DELIMITED WITH TABS (\t).

## Takes two parameters.

## First, the full file name of the Portal's class list file with the header
##	 material stripped off.  The section should be added at the end.

## Second, the full file name of the output WeBWorK classlist file

## Note:  currently we have to pre-process the file through R in order
##    to get this script to work.
