## convertGC
##
## This is a specific routine for reading class lists which comes from the Portal
## at Georgetown College and producing a classlist file usable by WeBWorK

## It is modified from a script written for the University of Rochester.

## IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE INPUT FILE IS DELIMITED WITH TABS (\t).

## Takes two parameters.

## First, the full file name of the Portal's class list file with the header
##	 material stripped off, a column for the section added at the end, and saved
## as a tab-delimited file.

## Second, the full file name of the output WeBWorK classlist file

## The Portal's file should be in the same directory as this script.
